## 📌 Project Overview
This project focuses on detecting fraudulent mobile money transactions using advanced Machine Learning techniques. The dataset is highly imbalanced, mimicking real-world financial data where fraud cases are rare but costly.

The goal was to build a robust pipeline that prioritizes **Precision and Recall (F1-Score)** over simple Accuracy, ensuring that actual fraud cases are caught while minimizing false alarms.

## 🚀 Key Features & Methodologies

### 1. **Rigorous Data Preprocessing**
* **Data Leakage Prevention:** Strictly applied the "Split-First, Scale-Later" methodology. Feature selection (`SelectKBest`) and Scaling (`StandardScaler`) were fit **only** on the training set to prevent information from the test set leaking into the model.
* **Feature Engineering:**
    * Derived `hour_of_day` from the time-step column to capture temporal fraud patterns.
    * Calculated `balance_error` to flag discrepancies in origin and destination accounts.

### 2. **Handling Class Imbalance**
* Used **SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique)** to balance the training data, allowing models to learn the "Fraud" class effectively without bias.
* *Note: SMOTE was applied strictly to the training set, keeping the test set pure.*

### 3. **Automated Model Comparison**
* Implemented an automated pipeline to train and evaluate **9 different algorithms**:
    * **Ensemble Methods:** Random Forest, XGBoost, LightGBM, CatBoost.
    * **Neural Networks:** Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP).
    * **Traditional ML:** Logistic Regression, KNN, Naive Bayes, Decision Trees.
* Used `GridSearchCV` for hyperparameter tuning (optimizing for F1-Score).

## 📊 Model Performance Results

We evaluated models based on **ROC-AUC** and **F1-Score**, as Accuracy is misleading for imbalanced datasets.

| Model | Accuracy | F1 Score | ROC AUC |
| :--- | :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **MLP (ANN)** 🏆 | **99.66%** | **0.4383** | **0.9989** |
| XGBoost | 99.42% | 0.3067 | 0.9996 |
| Random Forest | 98.01% | 0.1141 | 0.9909 |
| Logistic Regression | 94.87% | 0.0464 | 0.9222 |

> **Winner:** The **MLP (Artificial Neural Network)** was selected as the final model due to its superior balance of Precision and Recall, achieving the highest ROC-AUC score of ~0.999.
